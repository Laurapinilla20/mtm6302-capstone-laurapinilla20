CAPSTONE PROJECT 

Name: Laura Pinilla
Student Number: 90541117232
Project I Intend to Complete: Astronomy Picture of the Day Search.

"CosmicFrame" was created to help people connect with their special moments. Every important date, whether itâ€™s a birthday, anniversary, or personal achievement, is filled with memories and emotions. By capturing how the sky looked on those days, we offer a unique way to relive those memories and remind ourselves that the universe celebrated with us. Each astronomical image serves as a beautiful reminder of how our lives align in unexpected and wonderful ways.
